## The shape of the data

Each list element in train_x is a single review.
The features of each review make up a vector of words, which are notated by their
rank based on their frequency.
  Therefore, we work with numbers instead of words. 

## Data processing

* Deep learning models don't take lists of features; they need to be converted
into tensors.

## Model building

Training X: matrix
Training Y: vector

Fully connected networks with dense layers and relu activators work well with
this type of problem.

The number of hidden units determines how complex representation we allow our
model to assume. Choosing the number of hidden units is an art, not a science.

Key architectural decisions: 

* How many layers?
* How many hidden units?
